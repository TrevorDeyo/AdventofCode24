# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository houses my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

Each day brings two new puzzles, and this repository will be updated daily (or as frequently as I can tackle them!) with my Python 3 solutions.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by day, making it easy to navigate and find a specific challenge:

* Each day's puzzles will have its own dedicated folder (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`, etc.).

* Inside each `day_XX` folder, you will typically find:

  * `part1.py`: My solution for the first part of the day's puzzle.

  * `part2.py`: My solution for the second part of the day's puzzle.

  * `input.txt`: The specific puzzle input I used (obtained from the Advent of Code website after logging in).

  * `example.txt` (optional): Any example inputs provided by the puzzle for testing.
 
  * ├── day_01/
│   ├── part1.py
│   ├── part2.py
│   └── input.txt
├── day_02/
│   ├── part1.py
│   ├── part2.py
│   └── input.txt

## How to Run My Solutions

To run any of my solutions:

1. **Clone the repository:**

3. **Navigate to the desired day's folder:**

4. **Run the Python script:**
python part1.py
or
python part2.py

*Make sure the `input.txt` file (and `example.txt` if the script uses it) is in the same directory as the script you are running.*

## My Approach & Goals

My primary goal for Advent of Code 2024 is to:

* **Practice Problem Solving:** Sharpen my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

* **Reinforce Python Knowledge:** Deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python 3.

* **Explore Efficiencies:** Where possible, I'll aim for efficient and elegant solutions, though readability will always be a priority.

* **Learn New Techniques:** Experiment with different data structures and algorithms as puzzles demand.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is created and maintained by **Eric Wastl**. It's a fantastic way to keep your programming skills sharp and learn new things in a fun, gamified environment.
